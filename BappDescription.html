<p>This is an extension for Burp Suite Professional, designed to help you scan for PHP Object Injection vulnerabilities on popular PHP Frameworks and some of their dependencies. It will send a serialized PHP Object to the web application designed to force the web server to perform a DNS lookup to a Burp Collaborator Callback Host.</p>
<p>The payloads for this extension are all from the excellent Ambionics project PHPGGC. PHPGGC is a library of PHP unserialize() payloads along with a tool to generate them, from command line or programmatically. You will need it for further exploiting any vulnerabilities found by this extension.</p>
<p>You should combine your testing with the PHP Object Injection Check extension from Securify so you can identify other possible PHP Object Injection issues that this extension does not pick up.</p>
